# TASK 4.2
**Module 4. Networking Fundamentals**

**Dmytro Steblyna**

# Part 1

- Here I created a corporate network containing 2 houses with 2 floors in each. The horizontal subsystem of the floor consists of one workgroup of 5 computers each. I put a switch on each working group. Then I connected all switches to the router and configured subnets for each workgroup. And after configuration, I checked functionality of the network.

# Part 3

- Here I created a local area network of a complex of 5 one-story buildings based on a router with one port. One building - 1 working group with 6 computers. For each workgroup, I created its own VLAN. I also configured DHCP to automatically allocate IP addresses for end devices. And after configuration, I checked functionality of the network.
