# Results of my work with Git

**Dmytro Steblyna**

I've improved my knowledge of Git and Github, in particular - working with branches and resolving merge conflicts.
I created a new repository for the tasks. Created several branches (master, develop, images, styles) and files in each of them. 
Pushed all the files and branches to Github. Then I merged the branches 'images' and 'styles' into the 'development branch, and resolved merge conflict.
And then I merged the develop branch into master. And also pushed all the changes to Github. 
Using the command 'git reflog', I created a small report called 'task1.1_GIT.txt' and also pushed it to the repository.


**How I understand DevOps**

DevOps allows us to improve development efficiency and product quality through SDLC automation. 
For example, you can pack the entire service into one package. Then deploy and scale it in seconds. 
DevOps tools enable us to develop software more flexibly, deploy updates faster, improve product stability and security, and reduce development risks.
